Project 3

How can I add a line of config to each access port on the network? 

Don't modify mytools, it contains the function for getpass.

Do add/remove devices from devices.json for which devices you would like the script to run on.

The lines of config in add-interface-config.txt are applied to each matched access-port. 

The script will need two arguments to be ran: accessports.py devices.json
